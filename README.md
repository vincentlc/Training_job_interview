# 🛠️ Tech Interview Practice

This repository contains my **practice projects, coding exercises, and TDD examples** in **Python** and **C++**, created as part of a structured self-training program to prepare for technical interviews.  

It includes solutions to algorithm problems, object-oriented design exercises, and small test-driven development (TDD) projects.  
The goal is to **demonstrate coding fluency, clean design, and professional development workflow**.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Python
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install pytest
````

* Run tests for a given exercise:

  ```bash
  pytest Python/Day1_dict_set/test_word_count.py
  ```

### C++

* Build and run with your compiler (example using `g++`):

  ```bash
  g++ -std=c++17 -o test StudentRegistry.cpp test_StudentRegistry.cpp
  ./test
  ```
* For more advanced tests, integrate with [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest).

## 📚 Topics Covered

* **Python**: dict, set, list comprehensions, enumerate, zip, map/filter, OOP, TDD with pytest
* **C++**: STL containers (map, unordered\_map, set, vector), iterators, OOP, TDD with GoogleTest
* **Algorithms**: sorting, two-pointer, binary search, recursion, basic dynamic programming
* **TDD**: test-first approach, pytest (Python), GoogleTest (C++)
* **Git**: branching, commits, pull requests, professional workflow

---

## 🎯 Goal

* Strengthen fundamentals in **Python and C++**
* Practice common **algorithm and data structure patterns** used in interviews
* Apply **test-driven development** and clean coding practices
* Build a **visible portfolio** of structured, documented projects
